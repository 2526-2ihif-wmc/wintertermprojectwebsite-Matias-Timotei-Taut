            <h3>What is a Desktop Computer?</h3>
            <p>A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a single location. Unlike portable devices, desktop computers consist of separate components including a system unit (tower), monitor, keyboard, and mouse. They are called "desktop" computers because they typically sit on or under a desk.</p>
            <p>Desktop computers are preferred for tasks requiring high performance, extensive multitasking, and easy upgradability. They offer superior cooling systems, allowing for sustained high-performance operations without thermal throttling.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- History Section -->
        <div class="box highlight">
            <h3>Brief History</h3>
            <p>Desktop computers evolved from room-sized mainframes in the 1940s-1950s to personal computers in the 1970s-1980s. The IBM PC (1981) and Apple Macintosh (1984) revolutionized computing by making it accessible to individuals and small businesses. Today's desktops are millions of times more powerful than those early machines while being more affordable.</p>

        <!-- Main Components Section -->
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Main Components Explained</h3>
            
            <div class="item">
                <h4>1. CPU (Central Processing Unit) - The Brain</h4>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> The CPU executes instructions from programs and performs calculations. It's measured in GHz (gigahertz) and cores. Modern CPUs have multiple cores (4-16+ cores) allowing them to handle many tasks simultaneously.</p>
                <p><strong>Popular brands:</strong> Intel (Core i3, i5, i7, i9) and AMD (Ryzen 3, 5, 7, 9)</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> An Intel Core i7 with 8 cores can run video editing software while streaming music and browsing the web simultaneously.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>2. RAM (Random Access Memory) - Short-term Memory</h4>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> RAM temporarily stores data that the CPU is actively using. When you open a program or file, it loads into RAM for quick access. More RAM allows you to run more programs smoothly.</p>
                <p><strong>Typical amounts:</strong> 8GB (basic), 16GB (recommended), 32GB+ (professional work)</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Having 16GB RAM allows you to have 20+ browser tabs open, Word, Excel, and Photoshop running simultaneously without slowdowns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>3. Storage - Long-term Memory</h4>
                <p><strong>HDD (Hard Disk Drive):</strong> Traditional spinning disk storage. Slower but cheaper. Good for storing large files like videos and photos (1TB-8TB common).</p>
                <p><strong>SSD (Solid State Drive):</strong> No moving parts, much faster. Makes your computer boot in seconds and programs load instantly (256GB-2TB common).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A computer boots from an SSD in 10 seconds vs 2 minutes from an HDD.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>4. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) - Graphics Card</h4>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Processes visual information and displays images on your monitor. Essential for gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, and AI applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Types:</strong> Integrated (built into CPU, basic tasks) or Dedicated (separate card, gaming/professional work)</p>
                <p><strong>Popular brands:</strong> NVIDIA (GeForce RTX/GTX) and AMD (Radeon RX)</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> An NVIDIA RTX 4070 can run modern games at 4K resolution with ray tracing effects at 60+ FPS.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>5. Motherboard - The Nervous System</h4>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Connects all components together. It determines what CPU, RAM, and other parts you can use. Contains the BIOS/UEFI that starts your computer.</p>
                <p><strong>Important features:</strong> Number of RAM slots, USB ports, expansion slots for graphics cards, built-in WiFi/Bluetooth</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>6. Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h4>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Converts electricity from your wall outlet (AC) to the type your computer needs (DC). Measured in watts (W).</p>
                <p><strong>Typical wattage:</strong> 450W (basic), 650W (gaming), 850W+ (high-end)</p>
                <p><strong>Efficiency ratings:</strong> 80 Plus Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum (higher = less wasted electricity)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>7. Cooling System</h4>
                <p><strong>Air cooling:</strong> Fans blow air through heatsinks to dissipate heat. Cheaper and reliable.</p>
                <p><strong>Liquid cooling:</strong> Uses liquid coolant in tubes to transfer heat. Quieter and better for high-performance systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Overheating reduces performance and can damage components.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>8. Case (Chassis)</h4>
                <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Houses and protects all components, provides airflow, and organizes cables.</p>
                <p><strong>Sizes:</strong> Full Tower (largest), Mid Tower (most common), Mini Tower (compact)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>9. Peripherals</h4>
                <p><strong>Monitor:</strong> Displays visual output. Key specs include resolution (1080p, 1440p, 4K), refresh rate (60Hz, 144Hz, 240Hz), and panel type (IPS, TN, VA).</p>
                <p><strong>Keyboard & Mouse:</strong> Input devices for controlling the computer. Gaming versions offer faster response times and programmable keys.</p>
                <p><strong>Speakers/Headphones:</strong> Audio output devices.</p>
