            <div class="item">
                <h4>Myth: "Laptops are just as powerful as desktops now"</h4>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> While high-end laptops are very powerful, desktop equivalents are still 30-50% faster due to power/thermal constraints. Physics of heat dissipation haven't changed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h4>Myth: "Desktops are outdated/dying"</h4>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Desktop market is stable. Gamers, professionals, and enthusiasts still prefer desktops for performance and upgradability. Not going anywhere.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h4>Myth: "You can't upgrade laptops at all"</h4>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Storage (SSD) is usually upgradeable. Some gaming/business laptops allow RAM upgrades. Not as limited as people think, but still restricted compared to desktop.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h4>Myth: "Gaming laptops overheat and break quickly"</h4>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Modern gaming laptops have improved cooling significantly. With proper care (clean vents, use cooling pad, don't block airflow), they last 4-6 years like any laptop.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h4>Myth: "Building a PC is hard and risky"</h4>
                <p><strong>Reality:</strong> Modern PC building is like adult LEGO. Parts only fit one way. Thousands of YouTube tutorials. PCPartPicker checks compatibility. First-timers succeed regularly.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Both desktop computers and laptops have earned their place in the computing world. The "best" choice depends entirely on your individual needs, budget, and lifestyle. There is no wrong choice - only the choice that fits YOUR situation.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Desktops offer superior performance, upgradability, and value. Laptops offer unmatched portability, convenience, and space efficiency. Identify your priorities, and the choice becomes clear.</p>
            <p>Remember: Technology is a tool to enhance your life and work. Choose the tool that serves your needs best, not what's "popular" or what others recommend without knowing your situation.</p>
