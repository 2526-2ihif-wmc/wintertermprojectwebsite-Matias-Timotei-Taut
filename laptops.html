            <h3>What is a Laptop?</h3>
            <p>A laptop (also called a notebook) is a portable personal computer that integrates all the components of a desktop computer into a single, compact unit. The defining feature is portability - laptops can be carried and used anywhere thanks to their built-in battery, integrated screen, keyboard, and trackpad.</p>
            <p>Modern laptops range from ultra-thin ultrabooks weighing under 3 pounds to powerful gaming laptops with desktop-class performance. They've become the primary computing device for many people due to their flexibility and convenience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box highlight">
            <h3>Evolution of Laptops</h3>
            <p>The first portable computer, the Osborne 1 (1981), weighed 24 pounds and had a tiny 5-inch screen. The term "laptop" emerged in the 1980s. Major milestones include: the IBM ThinkPad (1992) introducing the TrackPoint, Apple's MacBook series (2006+) popularizing aluminum unibody designs, and ultrabooks (2011+) achieving incredible thinness while maintaining performance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>Laptop Components Explained</h3>
            
            <div class="item">
                <h4>1. Mobile Processors (CPU)</h4>
                <p><strong>Key difference from desktop:</strong> Laptop CPUs are designed for lower power consumption and heat generation. They have lower clock speeds but better efficiency.</p>
                <p><strong>Intel naming:</strong> "H" suffix = high performance (gaming/workstation), "U" suffix = ultra-low power (thin laptops), "P" suffix = balanced performance</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Intel Core i7-13700H vs i7-13700 (desktop) - laptop version uses 45W, desktop uses 65W+, but laptop is still very powerful</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>2. RAM (Usually Soldered)</h4>
                <p><strong>Important consideration:</strong> Many modern laptops have RAM soldered to the motherboard, making upgrades impossible. Always buy enough RAM initially.</p>
                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> 8GB minimum (basic use), 16GB (recommended for most), 32GB (content creation, heavy multitasking)</p>
                <p><strong>Speed matters:</strong> Laptops typically use LPDDR4x or DDR5 RAM, which is faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>3. Storage (Usually Upgradeable)</h4>
                <p><strong>Modern laptops use SSDs:</strong> Nearly all laptops now use M.2 NVMe SSDs, which are tiny sticks about the size of a stick of gum but incredibly fast.</p>
                <p><strong>Capacity recommendations:</strong> 256GB (minimum), 512GB (sweet spot), 1TB+ (storing large files, games)</p>
                <p><strong>Good news:</strong> Storage is one of the few components you can upgrade in most laptops</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>4. Display Technology</h4>
                <p><strong>Screen sizes:</strong> 13" (ultra-portable), 14"-15.6" (mainstream), 17" (desktop replacement)</p>
                <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1920x1080 (Full HD, standard), 2560x1440 (QHD, sharper), 3840x2160 (4K, very sharp but drains battery)</p>
                <p><strong>Panel types:</strong> IPS (best colors and viewing angles), OLED (perfect blacks, vivid colors), TN (cheaper, worse colors)</p>
                <p><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 60Hz (standard), 120Hz-144Hz (smoother scrolling), 240Hz+ (gaming)</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A 15.6" 1080p IPS display is sharp enough for most tasks and saves battery vs 4K</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>5. Graphics (GPU)</h4>
                <p><strong>Integrated graphics:</strong> Built into the CPU. Good for office work, video streaming, light photo editing. Intel Iris Xe or AMD Radeon are common.</p>
                <p><strong>Dedicated graphics:</strong> Separate GPU chip for gaming and creative work. NVIDIA GeForce RTX/GTX or AMD Radeon RX.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> RTX 4060 laptop GPU can run most games at 1080p high settings at 60+ FPS</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>6. Battery Life</h4>
                <p><strong>Capacity measured in Wh (watt-hours):</strong> 40-50Wh (small/budget), 60-70Wh (mainstream), 80-100Wh (premium/long battery life)</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world expectations:</strong> Office work 6-10 hours, video streaming 4-8 hours, gaming 2-4 hours</p>
                <p><strong>Factors affecting battery life:</strong> Screen brightness (biggest factor), CPU/GPU load, background apps, WiFi usage</p>
                <p><strong>Tips for longer battery:</strong> Lower screen brightness, use power saving mode, close unnecessary programs, disable Bluetooth when not needed</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>7. Keyboard & Trackpad</h4>
                <p><strong>Key travel:</strong> How far keys press down. 1.5mm+ is comfortable. Ultrabooks often have 1-1.3mm (shallower but usable)</p>
                <p><strong>Backlighting:</strong> Essential for typing in dark environments. Some have RGB (each key different color), most have white backlight</p>
                <p><strong>Trackpad:</strong> Larger is better. Premium laptops use precision glass trackpads. Look for Windows Precision Touchpad support</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>8. Ports & Connectivity</h4>
                <p><strong>USB-A:</strong> Traditional rectangular USB port (USB 3.2 Gen 1/2 for fast transfer)</p>
                <p><strong>USB-C/Thunderbolt:</strong> Smaller reversible port. Can charge laptop, transfer data, connect displays all through one cable</p>
                <p><strong>HDMI:</strong> Connect to external monitors/TVs</p>
                <p><strong>3.5mm audio jack:</strong> For headphones/speakers</p>
                <p><strong>SD card reader:</strong> Useful for photographers</p>
                <p><strong>WiFi 6/6E:</strong> Latest wireless standard, faster and more reliable. WiFi 6E adds 6GHz band for less interference</p>
                <p><strong>Bluetooth 5.0+:</strong> Connect wireless peripherals, headphones</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>9. Build Quality & Materials</h4>
                <p><strong>Plastic:</strong> Cheaper, lighter, but feels less premium and less durable</p>
                <p><strong>Aluminum:</strong> Premium feel, durable, better heat dissipation, common in mid-range to high-end laptops</p>
                <p><strong>Magnesium alloy:</strong> Very light and strong, used in premium ultrabooks</p>
                <p><strong>Carbon fiber:</strong> Extremely light and strong, found in premium business laptops like ThinkPad X1 Carbon</p>
            </div>

            <div class="item">
                <h4>10. Cooling System</h4>
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Laptops have limited space for cooling, leading to thermal throttling (reducing performance when hot)</p>
                <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Heat pipes transfer heat from CPU/GPU to fans, vapor chambers (premium laptops) spread heat more evenly</p>
                <p><strong>Noise:</strong> Thinner laptops often have louder fans. Gaming laptops balance noise vs cooling</p>
                <p><strong>User tip:</strong> Use on hard surfaces, not beds/blankets which block air vents</p>
            </div>
        </div>
